Feature selection (FS) is the process of reducing input data dimension. By reducing dimensionality,
FS attempts to solve two important problems: facilitate learning (inducing) accurate classifiers, and
discover the most ”interesting” features, which may provide for better understanding of the problem
itself (Guyon and Elisseeff, 2003).
